# Image Classification On Handwritten Digits Using Multiclass Classification

Uses [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) handwritten digits dataset. The dataset consists 10 handwritten digits (0,1,...,9).
The training data consists of 60000 images of size $28 \times 28$ pixels; the test data consists of 10000 images.

- Implemented image classification on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using a two-layer neural network, incorporating loss functions, gradients, and optimizers for effective training.
- Utilized Multiclass classification to distinguish between 10 handwritten digits (0-9) with a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
- Leveraged Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and Numpy for numerical operations to facilitate the development and analysis of the neural network model.
- Achieved improved classification accuracy through iterative optimization and model refinement, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning and neural network frameworks.
